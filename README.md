# Knearest-Neighbors-Project
This project applies the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify data points based on their feature similarity.
It was developed as part of the *Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp* and serves as a practical exercise in applying a non-parametric supervised learning algorithm.

The goal of this project is to build, train, and evaluate a **KNN classification model** on a provided dataset.

## Dataset Description
The dataset (provided in the course materials) contains several numerical features along with a target class label.
Each row represents an observation, and the task is to predict the correct class for new observations based on the distance from existing data points.

## Objectives
- Load and explore the dataset
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualize patterns
- Standardize the features for optimal KNN performance
- Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using scikit-learn
- Choose the optimal value of K by evaluating model performance on validation data
- Measure performance using metrics such as confusion matrix, accuracy, and classification report
  
## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- PyCharm

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
